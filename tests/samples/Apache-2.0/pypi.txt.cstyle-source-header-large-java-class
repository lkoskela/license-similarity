 * within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
 * The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add 
 * Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
 * NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying 
 * the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or 
 * different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any 
 * such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
 * complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
 * state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor 
 * shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

 * whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as 
 * deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for 
 * damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising 
 * as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages 
 * for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
 * losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or 
 * Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and 
 * charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
 * consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on 
 * Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
 * and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor 
 * by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  APPENDIX:
